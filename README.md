# wear-auth
This is an Android Wear app that lets you define a motion pattern as a "password", i.e. drawing a letter "8" in the 
air while wearing the Wear device. Then, you can re-authenticate by repeating the pattern. 

The program will determine whether the two motion traces match through dynamic programming, specifically an implementation of dynamic time warping: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping.
